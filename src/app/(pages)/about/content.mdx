### How do I get involved?

Everyone in the Computer Science Society is elected by you, the undergraduate students in CS.

Elections are now split up into two rounds. Nominations for the first round of positions which includes all head and executive positions takes place in February, and the second round for the rest of the positions takes place in March. If a student runs for a position in the first round and fails to get the votes, they may run for another position in the second round.

The vote for our two first-year representatives for the current school year usually takes place in September or October.

When the time comes, everyone will be notified via email and Discord on how to nominate and vote for CSS positions.

Here is the most current chart showing the hierarchy of positions on CSS:
